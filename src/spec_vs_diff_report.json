  "summary": "Diff adds core PWA assets (manifest, service worker, offline fallback page) and registers the service worker in the React app. However, the diff does not show the required icon PNG assets being added, and the README does not explicitly state that generating a Play Store .aab is out of scope. Additionally, project_state.json was modified with a React Native + Firebase/.aab-focused summary that conflicts with the BuildRequest constraints and was not requested.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Add required PWA icon assets to the frontend as static files and reference them from the web app manifest (do not serve icons via the backend).",
      "reason": "The manifest references icons under /assets/generated, but the diff does not show the actual PNG icon files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (or equivalent). Without the files present, the acceptance criteria for providing 192x192 and 512x512 icons is not met based on available evidence.",

      "requirement": "Add a short in-repo README section explaining how to publicly share the deployed app URL and how to install it on Android as a PWA, explicitly noting that Play Store upload requires a separate Android build outside this project.",
      "reason": "The added README includes production URL guidance and Android install steps, but it does not explicitly note that Play Store upload / generating an .aab requires a separate Android build outside this project (an explicit callout is required by the acceptance criteria).",
